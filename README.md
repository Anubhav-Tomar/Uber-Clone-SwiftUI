# Welcome to the Uber Clone app!

- This app is a clone of the popular ride-sharing app, Uber, and has been developed with scalable code in mind. This means that the app has been designed to be easily expandable and maintainable, making it easy for me or other developers to add new features and fix bugs.

- This app allows the user to request a ride using a simple pricing model that returns back real trip data on travel time and different prices between different ride types

Overall, this Uber Clone app is a good example of a well-designed, scalable app written purely in Swift/SwiftUI
